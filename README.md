# weather-app

weather app using third party API

## Task

this Challenge is to build a Weather Dashboard App. This app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. By using third-party API [OpenWeather One Call API](https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api) to retrieve weather data for cities, users can get real-time info on any city they want

## TODO

### Criteria

GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
WHEN I view the UV index
THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
